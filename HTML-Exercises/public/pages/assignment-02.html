Assignment 2 (HTML Attributes, Links and Images):

1. The html tag is missing a language attribute, add it and set the correct value for an english document.
2. Add a hyperlink reference to the anchor tag that takes you to another assignment when you click on it.
3. Add a style attribute to the paragraph with some CSS (If you don't know any CSS yet you can use the value "color: green" to change the text-color.
4. Make sure nobody can click that button by adding a disabled attribute to it.
5. Add an image somewhere in the body of the document (You can use an online image as source (e.g. https://placekitten.com/300/300)). Make sure
   the image has an alt attribute.
6. Add a base tag to change the starting point for links to the online version of this repository.
   Your link from step 3 should still work, but should now open the online version of the same assignment.
