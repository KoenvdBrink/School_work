Assignment 5 (HTML SEO & Metadata):

1. Copy your code from Assignment 4 and paste it below.
2. Perform a Lighthouse audit for 'SEO'
3. Make sure you solve all of the errors (except for the one described below) under the "Best Practices" sub-category
   (You do not need to solve the User Experience error: 'Serves images with low resolution'. 
   You also don't need to solve the error within the 'Trust and safety' categrory)

TIP: Make sure you select "Desktop" as device when performing the lighthouse audit, if you select "Mobile" you will get more issues (e.g. with font-size).
