Assignment 01 (HTML Document structure):

If you view this assignment in the browser and you open the Chrome devtools (as described in the README), you can see the HTML structure under the 'Elements' tab.

1. Inspect the HTML structure in the browser (with Chrome devtools). Try to understand why you see more than only one element.
2. Make sure the document has a valid html structure.
3. Make sure the document has a valid html5 encoding (Character Sets).
4. Verify your implementation by performing a Lighthouse & axe audit. Make sure you get a score of 80% or higher for 'Accessibility'.
