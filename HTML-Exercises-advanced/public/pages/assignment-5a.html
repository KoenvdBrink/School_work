Assignment 5a (HTML5 form validation):

There is one thing missing from the form, that is the validation. In this assignment we will see what kind of validation we can add to the various input elements.

1. Copy your code from Assignment 3a and paste it below.
2. Make sure all fields are required (except for the checkboxes and the input with type="color")
3. Make sure the name and email fields have a minimum length of 2 characters and a maximum length of 255 characters
4. Make sure the age input has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 150
5. Make sure the phone input matches the following pattern "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}"

In the next assignment we will make the form accessible and test it with a screen reader.
