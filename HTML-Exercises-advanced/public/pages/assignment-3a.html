Assignment 3a (Other input types):

There are still many other input types to choose from. Lets improve the form from the previous assignment some more.

1. Copy your code from Assignment 2 and paste it below.
2. Change the "Age" input type so only numbers can be entered.
3. Change the "Date of Birth" input type so users can pick a date with the mouse
4. Change the "Phone Number" input type so screen readers will know a phone number is expected inside of the input box
5. Change the "Email address" input type so only valid email addresses can be entered in this field
6. Change the "Favorite Color?" input type so the users can pick a color instead of having to type it manually
7. Fill in the form and click on submit and check if the correct values are visible in the URL.
8. Try to enter an invalid email and click on submit

NOTE: Your code will be improved upon in a later assignment, we will add some form validation.
