Assignment 5b (Making the form accessible):

In this assignment we will make the form accessible and test it with a screen reader.

1a. Copy your code from Assignment 5a and paste it below.
1b. Test the form in its current state with a screen reader (use {TAB} to navigate to the next input)
    If you have added labels, most of the form is already understandable, only the inputs without a label will need some extra work.
2a. Make sure they are also linked to their own labels (these labels need id's for this too)
2b. Make sure the screen reader will say the word "Gender" followed by the selected choice when selecting one of the gender options
3. Follow the same steps for the checkboxes
4. The only thing that is not yet fully accessible are the error messages, unfortunately this can not be solved by just using HTML.
   There are many ways to solve this with Javascript, one of the ways is to collect the error messages and place them in an html-element
   with the aria-live="assertive" attribute from assignment 1.
   This will make sure the errors are read out loud to the user.
   You will not have to do this in this assignment, but it's good to keep in mind.
