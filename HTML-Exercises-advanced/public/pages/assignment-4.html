<!--
Assignment 4 (Other input types):

There are 5 forms below, fix one problem in each of these forms.

1a. Make sure the first form will submit to the following url "static/data.html"
1b. Click submit and see if the data you send is displayed on the target page

2a. Make sure you send a POST request (instead of the default GET request) when submitting the second form
2b. Notice that the form-data is not included in the URL anymore with a POST request (maybe your last GET request is still visible in the URL)

3a. Notice that in the third form, when you click on the email or phone field, you will get some suggestions,
    this is because (in chrome) the suggestions feature is turned on automatically
    (If you open it in a browser you use regularly)
3b. Make sure autocomplete is turned off in the third form and reload the page.
3c. Notice that these suggestions are now gone

4a. Look at form 4 (You do not have to change anything to this form)
4b. Notice if you fill in one of the fields the other one is also filled in automatically
    (If you open it in a browser you use regularly)

5. Add the correct encoding to the fifth form to send a file.
