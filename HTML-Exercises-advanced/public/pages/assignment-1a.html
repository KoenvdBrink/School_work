7. Add a textarea to the second fieldset and make it 4 rows long
8. Give each of the <input> and <textarea> elements a 'name' attribute with a unique value
9. Make sure this textarea has a label too
10. Add 3 buttons below the second <fieldset> element (make sure the buttons are inside of the <form> element)
11. Give each of the buttons a different type attribute (button, submit and reset)
12a. Put some text in some of the input-boxes and click on the reset button
12b. Put some text in some of the input-boxes, click on the button with type 'button' (nothing should happen)
12c. Put some text in some of the input-boxes, click on the submit button and look at the URL
